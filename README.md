## Objective

- 📱 **Develop a mobile application (Android)** for personalized skincare recommendations.
  
- 🧠 **Implement a machine-learning model** for Skin Problem Classification. This model will analyze user-uploaded facial photos and identify specific skin concerns (e.g., dark spots, acne, pores).
  
- 💡 **Design a recommendation system** that goes beyond skin type identification. This system will offer personalized skincare product packages tailored to individual skin concerns.
  
- 😌 **Simplify the skincare product selection process** for users. This will be achieved by providing a user-centric application with clear and actionable recommendations.
  
- 📚 **Promote informed decision-making** regarding skincare products. This will be done by leveraging machine learning and personalized analysis.
  
- ♻️ **Reduce product waste** in the skincare industry. This will be achieved by recommending effective product packages that directly address users' specific needs.
