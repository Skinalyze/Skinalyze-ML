Since GitHub is generally designed to handle source code,
it is not the best place to store large files.

We recommend using the Google Drive Link to download the Keras model
and the TFLite model.

The Keras model and the TFLite model can be downloaded from the following links:

- [Keras Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-hZSuFW4gXo3pQ0PmVA95fSAbhKxVsEs/view?usp=drive_link)
